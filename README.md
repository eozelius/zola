## Getting Started
To get started copy or clone directory, and run `$ yarn start` or `$ npm start`.  NOTE: Make sure you have all dependencies of create-react-app installed.  The app should start the server and open your default browser to localhost:3000.  You can also see the app by navigating to localhost:3000

## Dependencies

  - npm v5.7.1
  - create-react-app v1.5.2
  - webpack v3.6.0
